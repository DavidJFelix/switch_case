===========

A Python implementation of switch and case statements.

This is Open Source under BSD license.  The example files shows how to use it,
including extensive documentation and examples.

This works under both Python 2.7 and 3.2 (as well as other Python versions, I'm sure).


I've seen a few implementations of Switch / Case -type statements in Python, but none 
of them looked very elegant.  So I decided to write one of my own.

Of course, I over-engineered it.  But I learned a lot.


View the switch_case_examples.py file to see how it works.
Feedback is encouraged!  I hope someone enjoys it!
